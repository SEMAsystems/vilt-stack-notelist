# Small Notes Application

## Description
Build a small web application that allows users to create, view, and delete short notes.

## Requirements

### 1. Laravel
- Create a `Note` model including a migration with appropriate fields.
- Notes should be **soft deletable**.
- Implement a controller to fetch, create, and delete notes.
- Implement **backend validation**.

### 2. Inertia + Vue
- Build a main page that lists all notes.
- Build a simple form for note creation.
- Each note can be deleted – implement this in a **clean and user-friendly way**.

### 3. Tailwind CSS
- Clean, modern & responsive layout.

### 4. Optional / Bonus
- Frontend validation (e.g. title must not be empty).
- Show simple user feedback after creating or deleting a note.
- Add a simple mailing feature — be creative 😉  
  *(Mailpit is included in the setup for email testing.)*

## Notes
- The solution does not need to be production-ready.
